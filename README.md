# Citi-Bike-Analytics
Using Tableau
In this an Analysis of the Bike rentals by Citibikes in the New Jersey - New York Metro Area. We have looked at the data for the month of September 2022. To decrease the data set, which was huge, we have looked at the data of only the peak hours. From 7 to 9 AM anf 5 to 7 PM. Here are some of the insights into the data. 

There is a HTML link in the Repository to access the analysis. It can also be seen on Tableau Public.
